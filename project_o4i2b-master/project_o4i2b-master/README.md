## FAQ
**Who is this application made for?** 

This application is made for anyone who needs a ToDo list! I would say it is developed around the needs of students but many other people have a need for similar features.

**Why have you created a ToDo list application when so many already exist?**

I became  weary of constantly trying out a ton of different ToDo list applications which didn't exactly have all the features I wanted. Those which did have the features usually needed a *premium membership* or had an ugly GUI.

**Does this work on Linux?**

You're in luck, this whole application is written on a computer that runs Ubuntu(subtle flex) and otherwise it's a Java application so it should be compatible on any device that has Java capabilties. If any compatibility issues arise Linux will priority.

**Can I integrate Google Calendar into this?**

It will depend on my time constraints but it is a feature I hope to implement eventually. No promises though.

**Is my information safe?**

Yes! This application runs on your computer so it won't have to transmit any data! The only exceptions will be during updates and if I ever implement some kind of cloud synchronization, if that is the case rest assured this whole application and libraries I create will be open source.

**My ToDo list crashed, what do I do?**

I can't do much without the logs but try to restart your computer and run the application. Otherwise save the logs and report the bug. I am more hesitant to troubleshoot for DOS systems because they suck.
